## Title: Develop an efficient CNN architecture for landuse segmentation of high-resolution imagery using Genetic algorithm and compare with other optimizers (Adam, GD, SGD)

`In this problem the task of semantic segmentation will be carried out by updating the weights by using Genetic algorithm. After the best result is generated it has to copmpared with the existing state-of-the-art optimizers such as Adam and SGD, GD.`
